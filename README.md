# requirement-analysis

The purpose of this repository is to initiate the documentation requirement of the StayEase project (AirBnB clone)

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is part of the foundational stage of every Software Development Lifecylce (SDLC). It involves engaging users, sponsors and the development team to establish pain points, needs, expectations and proposed solutions. The process will help eliminate gaps in understanding, provide a scope for the project, the cost and time involved.This requirement analysis seeks to highlight the needs or expectations of stakeholders of StayEase (AirBnB Clone). In essence it is a meeting of the minds session to ensure all stakeholders are on the same level of understanding.

### Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):

Requirement Analysis is paramount for the success of any software project because it lays the foundation for all subsequent phases. Its importance cannot be overstated for several reasons:

**Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction:** By clearly defining needs upfront, it ensures the final product aligns with what users and clients actually want and expect, leading to higher satisfaction. **Reduces Project Risks:** Ambiguous or poorly defined requirements are a leading cause of project failure, cost overruns, and delays. Thorough analysis mitigates these risks by identifying potential issues early.
**Improves Project Planning:** Clear requirements provide a solid basis for accurate project planning, including scope definition, effort estimation, resource allocation, and scheduling.
**Facilitates Design and Development:** Well-defined requirements serve as a blueprint for designers and developers, guiding them in creating a system that meets the specified functionalities and performance criteria.
**Enhances Quality Assurance:** Test cases and quality assurance efforts are directly derived from requirements. Clear requirements make it easier to verify that the developed software functions correctly and meets all specified criteria.
**Minimizes Rework and Costs:** Addressing issues during the requirements phase is significantly cheaper and less time-consuming than fixing them during development, testing, or after deployment.
**Fosters Communication:** It acts as a common language between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the project's objectives.
